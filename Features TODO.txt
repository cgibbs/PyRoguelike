TODO:
*Actually organize all of these files

*Dead Forest level? Set the walls to 'Y', and they're suddenly long-dead trees

*Chests and boxes, a la Nethack
--Objects have inventory, so capitalize on that

*"Sticky" terrain (can be used as/for a bear trap) - Prevents movement, but not attack

*"Totem" AI and objects
--for spell effects and permanent fixtures (electrical object in a puddle, for example)

*Spellbook for casters

*Pets for a Beastmaster class, with custom pets

*Disposable pets for necromancer, with summon spell to get more

*Improve tile class, to allow for different floor types, and floor effects
--carving "Elbereth", for example
--pits, water, acid, fuel, fire, or lava, for another
--fog is a good one, too
--give each tile its coords, for figuring out neighboring tiles for A* and such
--on tile mouseover, show attributes 
----if tile.mod_set: show attributes

*Add item qualities, both normal and enchanted
--Write effects as "<unenchanted> ______ of <enchantment>"
--Named for "best" mods, but can have more
--Fireproof, acidproof, fire damage, acid damage, sharp, dull, deadly... 
--prefix and suffix booleans for whether there's a name on the weapon

*Money and a Shop

*Traps, beyond just mimics
--Ability to disarm, or find a "skeleton key", or whatever (skel key not auto-use)
--Spot system, for detecting traps (traps should also be drawn at back, but give 
    a message when spotted)

*Doors, and trapped versions
--Keys: just have a numerical value to match a key to a door, if doing special keys

*Overhaul dungeon generation for more types of rooms
--Include miscellaneous dungeon trappings, i.e. furniture

*Add monster variety

*A unique currency would be cool, but don't just rip off PoE

*Add A* pathfinding for SmartMonster AI (as its own method of the AI, for extensibility)

*Better attacking variety in AI
--Use a dictionary of possible attacks (for example: Humanoid uses weapon, or unarmed if none; Dragon uses breath weapon and/or claws), with a corresponding AI to handle the specific types of attacks.

*Perks

*New AI movement
-- the AI can't get around corners

*More varied AI
-- dragons, definitely; classes for humanoids (with behaviors) would be brilliant

*Ranged combat
-- for player AND monsters

*Cone spells

*Multiple save/load states

*Blood splatters


COMPLETED:

*Mimics

*Fixed Stat Bar mechanism to round properly

*Encapsulated object creation into separate methods (for Mimics, and for code neatness)

*Fixed 'a' vs 'an' in Item.picked_up()

*Look system
--More like an "in-depth description" viewing system

*Added inputbox() for text entry
--Make inputbox() actually handle text input worth a fuck

*'Push' spell

*'Ice Wall' spell

*Nerfed sword and shield bonuses by 1 each

*Dice combat, rather than flat damage
-- Pass a dice value as a tuple to Objects, in the format (amt, die) for both
monster Hit Die and unarmed attack. 

*Sorted Inventory
